# Corrective RAG (CRAG) Implementation with LangGraph

The concept of Corrective Retrieval-Augmented Generation (CRAG) was introduced in the research paper titled **“Corrective Retrieval Augmented Generation” by Shi-Qi Yan, Jia-Chen Gu, Yun Zhu, and Zhen-Hua Ling**. This paper was first published on January 29, 2024 and is avilable at the following [link.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15884?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

In their work, the authors address the issue of hallucinations in large language models (LLMs) and the challenges posed when retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems rely on irrelevant or incorrect documents. To enhance the robustness of generated outputs, they propose the Corrective Retrieval-Augmented Generation (CRAG) framework, which includes a lightweight **retrieval evaluator** to assess the quality of retrieved documents and determine appropriate corrective actions. Additionally, the framework incorporates **large-scale web searches** to supplement static data.

The goal of this project is to experiment with CRAG implementation, described in the blog "Corrective RAG (CRAG) Implementation With LangGraph" by Ryan Ong / Datacamp.
